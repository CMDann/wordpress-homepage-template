This is a template file for a WordPress website. This file required Meteor Slides to display a slider at the top of the page. After the slider any page content you have added will be displayed. After the page content you will display the 5 most recent posts from the blog with an excerpt. 

You can see an example of this on the homepage over at http://www.cmdann.ca

You may take and alter this code but please give me credit. You can check out LICENSE.txt for the Apache license information.
